I'm Garfield Zhu, an ordinary yet laid-back software engineer.
My professional drive stems from the thrill of crafting fresh and engaging code, fueled by daily doses of lattes.
Outside of work, I find joy in basking in the afternoon sun and exploring the enchanting realms of video games, as well as animation.
Occasionally, I also indulge in the vibrant warmth of passionate moments. Life, to me, is a balance of coding adventures and the simple pleasures of existence.

I write code with hammers, drills, saws, and coffee. Despite the appearance of being busy building a spaceship, my stack is surprisingly a NULL.

As a self-proclaimed full-stack gamer, I have an eclectic taste for various game genres. However, it's the imaginative worlds crafted by Mr. Hidetaka Miyazaki that truly captivate me. His games hold a unique allure, making them the most enchanting and fascinating experiences in my gaming journey.
Thank you so much, Miyazaki san.

One more thing, "if you can't find me neither on GitHub or Teams, explore my footsteps in the gaming world."
