I'm Garfield Zhu, an ordinary yet laid-back software engineer.

My professional drive stems from the thrill of crafting fresh and engaging code, fueled by daily doses of lattes.
Outside of work, I find joy in basking in the afternoon sun and exploring the enchanting realms of video games, as well as animation.
Occasionally, I also indulge in the vibrant warmth of passionate moments. Life, to me, is a balance of coding adventures and the simple pleasures of existence.

I write code with hammers, drills, saws, and coffee. Despite the appearance of being busy building a spaceship, my stack is surprisingly a NULL.

"I've traveled from [Boletaria](https://demonssouls.fandom.com/wiki/Boletaria) to the [Lands Between](https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki/Lands_Between), fought from [Lordran](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Lordran) to [Lothric](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Lothric), and strolled through the alleys of [Yharnam](https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Yharnam) to beneath the walls of [Ashina Castle](https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com/Ashina+Castle). Each time comforting my weariness aside a flickering bonfire in the darkness, my soul strengthens, driving me forward with unwavering determination."

I'm a big fan of Mr. Hidetaka Miyazaki as well as all his "Soul" games. Trust me, if you manage to conquer a Souls-like game someday, you will not only be a gamer who cultivates a different appreciation for the games, but also be a connoisseur of life who passionately embraces every moment.

Long may the sun shine!

One more thing, "if you can't find me neither on GitHub or Teams, explore my footsteps in the gaming world."
