### History

#### 0. Stock - [Nasdaq: NVDA](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVDA:NASDAQ?window=MAX)
See the history of the stock [Nvidia](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVDA:NASDAQ?window=MAX) first.
<br/> üåä The tide of cutting-edge technologies bring NVIDIA where it is today.


#### 1. Begining
* 1993: Founded in Santa Clara, California, USA.
<br/><img width="240" src="https://www.nvidia.com/content/nvidiaGDC/us/en_US/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/copy_of_nv_carousel__292630713/item_1669209935575.coreimg.100.850.jpeg/1688446141198/nvidia-timeline-3d-graphics-1993.jpeg" />
* Founders: Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, Curtis Priem.
* Produce Graphic Cards for bussiness customers.
* 3D Graphics for gaming and multimedia markets.

#### 2. Developing

* ***1999: GeForce 256, the first GPU.***
<br/><img width="240" src="https://www.nvidia.com/content/nvidiaGDC/us/en_US/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/copy_of_nv_carousel__292630713/item_1669209940663.coreimg.100.850.jpeg/1688446141218/nvidia-timeline-gpu-1999.jpeg" />
* 1999: Nasdaq IPO.
* 2000: 3DFX (Voodoo, first customer-facing graphic card), the competitor, went bankrupt.
  <br/> Nvidia acquired 3DFX.
* As OEM, Nvidia produced GPUs for PC manufacturers.

#### 3. New Vision

* Facing to gaming market. (GeForce)
* Decoupling the GPU from the PC. Face to customers directly.
* ***2008: CUDA, the first GPU computing platform.***
<br/><img width="240" src="https://www.nvidia.com/content/nvidiaGDC/us/en_US/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/copy_of_nv_carousel__292630713/item_1669209938611.coreimg.100.850.jpeg/1688446141370/nvidia-timeline-cuda-2006.jpeg" />
* Iterate GPU every 2-year. Keeping optimize the performance.
* 2010: General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) concept for scientific computing supported by CUDA API.


#### 4. AI, AR, VR, Auto-pilot, Blockchain, Cloud

* 2015: CUDA enforced the Deep Learning neural network.
* 2016: Nvidia Drive PX, the first AI Auto-pilot platform.
* 2018: Nvidia announced Nvidia RTX‚Ñ¢ for real-time ray tracing.
<br/><img width="240" src="https://www.nvidia.com/content/nvidiaGDC/us/en_US/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/copy_of_nv_carousel__292630713/nv_teaser_copy.coreimg.100.850.jpeg/1690308833559/nvidia-rtx-professional.jpeg" />
* The raising of Blockchain and Cloud Computing make Nvidia widely adopted.

#### 5. Bitcoin, Mining age

* 2020: Bitcoin price raised to $20,000. The RTX 30 series was released.
* The mining age makes the GPU price doubled, trippled and even higher. 30 series are almost all mining cards.

#### 6. AI, Big Language Model, Metaverse

* 2017: Google announced their `Transformer` model for LLM. See [What is a transformer model](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/03/25/what-is-a-transformer-model/)
* 2021: GPT-3, one of the largest language model, was released by OpenAI.
* 2022: The ChatGPT is publicly announce. The big language model is popular.
* 2022: NVIDIA Omniverse‚Ñ¢ platform is released as fundational role of building metaverse.
* As the core infrastructure of training LLM, Nvidia is again on the top of the tide.

### Anecdotes

<details>
<summary>1. NVIDIA naming </summary>
<p>
Nvidia's first chip was named as `dot-NV`. "NV" is the abbreviation of <b><u>NEXT</u></b>, for they enjoy developing the next generation of products.
</p>
<p>
For corp name, they try to find a latin word with "NV" in it. They found "invidia" in Latin, the envy.
They want to be the envy of the industry. So they remove the "i" and named the company as "Nvidia". ü§£
</p>
<p>
Actually, they did it.

  Semiconductor etching is error-prone, especially for 7nm, 5nm even 3nm process. The yield rate is not high.

  The chips are design to be error tolerable. Each area on the chip is standalone and can be disabled via firmware if there is an error.
  If the 84 SM chip has 2 SMs disabled, it will be written as a 82 SM chip and wrapped as 3090. üòÜ
