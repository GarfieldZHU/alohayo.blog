# Web Application Authentication (4) - CSRF

I did not plan to have this page and it was just a section in [the first article of this series](https://alohayo.me/blog/auth-in-web-server-1). 
But when I have more practices about it, I found it misses too many (maybe not best, but necessary) practices to make a web site secure.

Thus, I'd like to expand the topic and talk about the CSRF specifically.
